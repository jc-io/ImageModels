# Sections of a Working Agreement

## Inspired from ISE Engineering Fundamentals Customer/Partner Engineering Playbook

A working agreement is a document, or a set of documents that describe how we work together as a team and what our
expectations and principles are.

The working agreement created by the team at the beginning of the project, and is stored in the repository so that it is
readily available for everyone working on the project.

The following are examples of sections and points that can be part of a working agreement but each team should compose
their own, and adjust times, communication channels, branch naming policies etc. to fit their team needs.

## General

- We work as one team towards a common goal and clear scope
- We make sure everyone's voice is heard, listened to
- We show all team members equal respect
- We work as a team to have common expectations for technical delivery that are documented in a Release Plan.
- We make sure to spread our expertise and skills in the team, so no single person is relied on for one skill
- All times below are listed in CET

## Communication

- We communicate all information relevant to the team through the Discord.
- We add all User Stories and Tasks through Jira.

## Work-life Balance


- We should reply to teammates who ask for and inqure about cetain code promptly.

## Quality and not Quantity

- We agree on a [Definition of Done](DefinitionofDone.md) for our user story's and sprints and live by it.
- We follow engineering best practices like the [Engineering Fundamentals Engineering Playbook](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook)

## Scrum Master

The Process Lead is responsible for leading any scrum or agile practices to enable the project to move forward.

- Facilitate standup meetings and hold team accountable for attendance and participation.
- Keep the meeting moving.
- Make sure all action items are documented and ensure each has an owner and a due date and tracks the open issues.
- Notes as needed after planning / stand-ups.
- Make sure that items are moved to the parking lot and ensure follow-up afterwards.
- Maintain a location showing team’s work and status and removing impediments that are blocking the team.
- Hold the team accountable for results in a supportive fashion.
- Make sure that project and program documentation are up-to-date.
- Guarantee the tracking/following up on action items from retrospectives (iteration and release planning) and from daily standup meetings.
- Facilitate the sprint retrospective.
- Coach Product Owner and the team in the process, as needed.

## Backlog Management

- We communicate what we are working on through the board
- We assign ourselves a task when we are ready to work on it (not before) and move it to active
- We capture any work we do related to the project in a user story/task
- We close our tasks/user stories only when they are done (as described in the [Definition of Done](DefinitionofDone.md))
- We work with the whole group if we want to add a new user story to the sprint
- If we add new tasks to the board, we make sure it matches the acceptance criteria of the user story (to avoid scope creep).
  If it doesn't match the acceptance criteria we should discuss with the PM to see if we need a new user story for the task or if we should adjust the acceptance criteria.

## Code Management

- We follow the git flow branch naming convention for branches 
- We merge all code into main branches through PRs after being Code Reviewed
- We always review existing PRs before starting work on a new task
- We look through open PRs at the end of stand-up to make sure all PRs have reviewers.
